#### Frontend

- React
- Next.js

I also made use of the `React-Swipy` library for the card swiping.

#### Backend (as an API)

- Node.js
- Express
- Foursquare API

This web app was originally made using my very basic react knowledge and the google maps API. It was very bad but the code can still be found in the `old` branch.

#### Getting Setup

1. Clone the repository locally
2. Navigate to /frontend and run `npm install`
3. Navigate to /backend and run `npm install`
4. Inside the `/backend/example.env` file, put your foursquare client_id and client_secret (info on getting these can be found [here](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api))
5. In the same file, ensure your list of allowed origins includes 'http://localhost:3000' (this is your frontend)
6. Rename your `example.env` to just `.env`
7. Inside of the /backend folder Run `npm start` to start the backend. You can see if this is working by visiting `http://localhost:3001`
8. Inside of the /frontend/src/utils folder, modify the `getPlaces` function so that the url points to your locally running backend (`http://localhost:3001`)
9. Inside of the /frontend folder, run `npm run dev` to start the frontend. You can also run `npm run build` followed by `npm start` to run the production build.

#### Contributing

I made this app as a way to solidify everything I have learned, but hopefully I have also made it easy enough to contribute despite that not being the goal of this project.

Feel free to fork the project and make whatever changes you want, I will happily merge them in if they are useful!

If you are stuck on what to work on but still want to contribute, check out the Github Issues as I will put any bugs or potential features there
